# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

AdminAI follows a modern microservices architecture with three main packages:

```
packages/
├── frontend/    # React-based UI
├── backend/     # Node.js API server
└── shared/      # Shared types and utilities
```

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing:

- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Three.js** for 3D visualizations
- **Material-UI** for consistent UI components
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates
- **TypeScript** for type safety

### Backend Architecture

The backend uses a modular architecture with:

- **Express.js** for HTTP API
- **WebSocket** for real-time communication
- **TypeORM** for database operations
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Kafka** for event streaming
- **Bull** for job queues

### Data Flow

1. Client requests flow through the frontend application
2. API requests are sent to the backend server
3. WebSocket connections maintain real-time updates
4. Backend processes requests and manages data
5. Database operations are handled through TypeORM
6. Redis caches frequently accessed data
7. Kafka handles event streaming
8. Results are sent back to the frontend

### Security Architecture

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- Secure WebSocket connections

### Monitoring and Logging

- System metrics collection
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Audit logging
- Real-time alerts

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed using:

- Docker containers
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Cloud provider services (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Load balancers for high availability
- CDN for static assets

## Development Workflow

1. Local development environment
2. Testing environment
3. Staging environment
4. Production environment

Each environment is isolated and configured separately.
